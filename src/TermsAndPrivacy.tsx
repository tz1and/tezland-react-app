            <u>Other data stored and used:</u><br/>
            It's probably worth noting that some (not very sensitive) data is stored locally in your browser, including wallet public key hashes.
            Also, the smart contracts store public key hashes and the "multiplayer" component uses public key hashes and signatures to authenticate users.
